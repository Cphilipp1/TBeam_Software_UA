source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows

Navigate to the project directory using Command Prompt:

```cmd
cd TDoA_Simulation
```

Create a virtual environment:

```cmd
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```cmd
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages:
